# SQL Query Explanation
The provided SQL query is as follows:
```sql
SELECT 
    GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) SEPARATOR ', ') AS full_name,
    city,
    SUM(CASE WHEN city = city THEN salary ELSE 0 END) AS total_salary
FROM 
    employee_salaries
GROUP BY 
    city;
```
- This query retrieves the full names, city, and total salary for employees stored in the `employee_salaries` table.
- The `GROUP_CONCAT` function is used to concatenate the first name and last name with a space separator for each group of employees in the same city.
- The `SUM` function calculates the total salary for each city, considering only the employees from that city.
- The query groups the results by city using the `GROUP BY` clause.
